Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. Elderly Care Monitoring: The Fall Detection model can be integrated into smart home systems or camera-assisted monitoring services to promptly identify when elderly individuals fall, enabling caregivers or family members to respond quickly to potential injuries or medical emergencies.

2. Workplace Safety: In high-risk work environments like construction sites or factories, the Fall Detection model can be implemented to monitor employees and detect any accidents, alerting supervisors or emergency medical services immediately to provide assistance.

3. Public Safety: Security cameras in public spaces such as parks, streets, or shopping centers can utilize the Fall Detection model to detect falls and possible criminal activities or accidents, allowing law enforcement or emergency services to respond in a timely manner.

4. Assisted Living Facilities: The Fall Detection model can help improve the safety of residents in assisted living facilities, nursing homes, or rehabilitation centers by monitoring common areas for falls and automatically notifying staff members when incidents occur.

5. Sports Injury Detection: The Fall Detection model can be used in gyms or sports centers to monitor athletes during training sessions, helping to quickly identify falls or injuries and enabling coaches or medical staff to intervene if necessary.
